Problem 1:


Program for following:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", for which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1
Note: You can choose a programming language of your own choice.



Solution:

def maxlength(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        mapp = {}
        l = 0
        r = 0
        maxlen = 0
        while(r < n):
            if s[r] in mapp:
                if mapp[s[r]] >= l:
                    l = mapp[s[r]] + 1
            length = r - l + 1
            maxlen = max(maxlen, length)
            mapp[s[r]] = r
            r += 1
        return maxlen
